-   [ ] Programmatic persistence of entities (basic CRUD support) using hibernate
-   [ ] All Tables are in 3NF, show your ERD.

## Non-Functional Requirements

-   [ ] 80% line coverage of all service layer classes
-   [ ] Generated Logging for ALL threshold level in your program
-   [ ] Mocking for unit testing

## Challenge Features (Required to Attempt and Learn at least 1)

-   [ ] Deploy a WebApp on Azure
-   [ ] Session-based caching to minimize calls to the database for already retrieved data
-   [ ] Utilization of JWT for user authentication

## Init Instructions

-   Create another new repostory within this organization for your web application with the `name_of_wedding_planner_p1_teamMemberInitials`
-   A README.md file in your repo describing the goal of this wedding planner, how to use it(the url endpoint calls), technologies used (with versions), ERD, how to initialize it, features and contributers. Optional: Include potential future goals of the project

## Presentation

-   Finalized version of the web application must be pushed to personal repository within this organization by the presentation date (February 25, 2022)
-   10-15 minute live demonstration of the web application; demonstration will be performed using PostMan to query your API's endpoints

## Suggestions:

-   **DAILY** git commits and pushes.
-   Prep the project as soon as possible.
-   Ask questions, get clarifications ASAP.
-   **HIGHLY RECOMMEND**: Working on a [Trello](https://trello.com/) board with your business partner to keep constant awareness of what needs to be "done"(hint: define what done means between the two of you) to complete your wedding planner application in time for the big launch on Friday Febraury 25th.
